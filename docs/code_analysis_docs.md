# Code Analysis Agent Documentation

## Overview
Code Analysis is a systematic process of evaluating source code to assess its quality, maintainability, performance, and security. This helps developers and organizations maintain high code standards and identify areas for improvement.

## Features

### 1. Quality Assessment
- Comprehensive evaluation of code quality with numerical scoring (0-100)
- Detailed analysis of code structure and organization
- Assessment of coding standards compliance

### 2. Core Metrics Analysis
- Architecture and Design evaluation
- Code Maintainability scoring
- Performance optimization analysis
- Security practices assessment
- Test coverage measurement

### 3. Technical Assessment
- Technology stack review
- Code complexity analysis
- Best practices adherence
- Documentation quality evaluation

### 4. Risk Assessment
- Security vulnerability identification
- Technical debt evaluation
- Potential risk factors
- Dependency analysis

### 5. Recommendations
- Actionable improvement suggestions
- Architecture enhancement proposals
- Security improvement recommendations
- Best practices implementation guidance

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install praisonaiagents gitingest
```

### 2. Data Models
```python
class CodeMetrics(BaseModel):
    category: str
    score: int
    findings: List[str]

class CodeAnalysisReport(BaseModel):
    overall_quality: int
    code_metrics: List[CodeMetrics]
    architecture_score: int

    complexity_metrics: Dict[str, int]
    best_practices: List[Dict[str, str]]
    potential_risks: List[str]
    documentation_quality: int
```

### 3. Agent Configuration
```python
code_analyzer = Agent(
    role="Code Analysis Expert",
    goal="Provide comprehensive code evaluation and recommendations",
    backstory="""Expert code analyst specializing in architecture review, 
    best practices, and technical debt assessment.""",
    verbose=True
)
```

### 4. Analysis Task Definition
```python
code_analysis_task = Task(
    description="""Analyze code repository and provide structured evaluation:
    
    1. Overall Quality (0-100)
    2. Core Metrics Analysis:
       - Architecture and Design
       - Code Maintainability
       - Performance Optimization
       - Security Practices
       - Test Coverage
    3. Technical Assessment:
       - Technology Stack Review
       - Code Complexity Analysis
       - Best Practices Adherence
       - Risk Assessment
    4. Recommendations:
       - Key Improvements
       - Architecture Suggestions
       - Security Enhancements""",
    expected_output="Detailed code analysis report with metrics and recommendations",
    agent=code_analyzer,
    output_pydantic=CodeAnalysisReport
)
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Analyzing Local Code
```python
result = analyze_code("/path/to/local/code")
```

### 2. Analyzing GitHub Repository
```python
result = analyze_code("https://github.com/username/repo")
```

## Output Format

The analysis report includes:
1. Overall quality score (0-100)
2. Detailed metrics for different aspects:
   - Architecture score
   - Maintainability score
   - Performance score
   - Security score
   - Test coverage
3. Lists of:
   - Key strengths
   - Areas for improvement
   - Technology stack
   - Recommendations
   - Best practices
   - Potential risks

## Best Practices
1. Regular Analysis: Run code analysis regularly as part of your development workflow
2. Version Control: Track analysis results over time to monitor improvements
3. Team Review: Review analysis results with the development team
4. Prioritization: Focus on high-impact improvements first
5. Documentation: Keep analysis reports for future reference

## Integration Tips
1. CI/CD Pipeline: Integrate code analysis into your CI/CD pipeline
2. Pre-commit Hooks: Run analysis before committing code
3. Code Review Process: Include analysis results in code reviews
4. Team Metrics: Use analysis results for team performance metrics
